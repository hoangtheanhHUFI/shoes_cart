   __________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 I am currently new to web development (Django's MVT Architecture and Janji), so, having only 24 hours to take the test is hard for me. ðŸ˜”

I'd like to express my gratitude to some Indian YouTubers who helped me install and run some 'Hello world' commands on Django.

 I've dedicated nearly 16 hours to learning how to use Django's MVT Architecture, but unfortunately, it still doesn't start as I want, and errors keep appearing. ðŸ˜ž

 I would be happy if I could have another chance to take the test with a longer time frame. I've done my best to study something new to me. 

 Thank you, Golden Owl, for creating this fun and challenging test. I love it!
